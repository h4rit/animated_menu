    'The most expensive thing in Mumbai is good living space. Mumbai being financial capital, you can earn bread & butter for family very easily but it is very difficult to have a good living space. And you have invested your hard earned money in a property (flat) long ago. Now time has approached where you would wish to go for Redevelopment. Today societyâ€™s trust factor with the Developers has unfortunately reduced tremendously. Thus we recommend you to be your own developer i.e. swayam (self) developer. \nWe, Swayam Redevelopment, are here to guide you through Self redevelopment Process.';
